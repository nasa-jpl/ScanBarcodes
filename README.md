# ScanBarcodes

ScanBarcodes is a SwiftUI view that scans barcodes using an iPhone or iPad camera.

  The framework uses [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/) for high performance video capture and barcode recognition. The view also provides optional control of the flashlight and the zoom level of the camera.

## Getting started

Try the [demo application](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ScanBarcodesDemo.git)

**Two important notes on usage:**

1. an actual phone is required (iOS simulator doesn't yet support the camera)
2. an entry in the app Info.plist for "Privacy - Camera Usage Description" is required to prompt for user permission to use the camera to scan barcodes.

The view takes two required arguments and two optional arguments:

- ```barcodeTypes: [AVMetadataMachineReadableCodeObject.ObjectType]``` (required)
- ```zoomLevel : Binding<Int>``` (optional, defaults to 1, values greater than 1 increase the zoom)
- ```flashlightOn: Binding<Bool>``` (optional, defaults to false)
- ```completion: @escaping (Result<String, BarcodeScanError>) -> Void)``` (required, a closure to execute when a result is obtained)
